# tmux-multi-click-copy-mode
This plugin emeulates more natural text selection behaviour when uisng a mouse.

Double-clicking the middle of a word will select the entire word and move TMUX into copy-mode.
Triple-clicking the middle of a line will select the entire line and move TMUX into copy-mode.

Found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46638561) after trying to enable this behaviour on my own - decided to wrap it into a TMUX Plugin.
